## Abstract

Most of us agree that computational reproducibility is important, but, how
should we get there?

The usual answer to this question is: proceed as usual, but when it gets close
to submitting the paper, go back over the work and tidy it up, to make it
reproducible.

I'm going to argue that this is a fundamental error.  We should *start* with
reproducible working practice, and build on that foundation, in teaching, and
research.  This leads to better, clearer science, more effective
collaboration, and a higher chance of true findings.

One objection is that teaching reproducible practice takes too much curriculum
time.  We believe we have refuted this objection with a series of courses
taught at Berkeley, in which we taught reproducible research as the basis for
practice and for understanding.  Our students were very successful at doing
substantial reproducible projects on open FMRI data.
